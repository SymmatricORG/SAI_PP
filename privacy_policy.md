# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** March 5, 2025

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to SAI, your AI-powered fashion assistant. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when you use our application.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect several types of information to provide and improve our service:

*   **Personal Information:** Name, email address, and other account details you provide when you register or update your account.
*   **Photos & Extracted Visual Attributes:**
    *   When you upload a photo for analysis, we require access to the specific image you select from your device or capture using the app. We do not access your entire photo gallery without your explicit permission for each image.
    *   Our app, S.AI, **does not collect or store facial recognition data.**
    *   From the image you upload, we analyze and extract the following visual attributes:
        *   Skin color
        *   Hair color
        *   Eye color
    *   This extracted color data is stored in our database. The uploaded image itself is stored temporarily (see Section 5).
*   **Device Information:** IP address, device type, operating system version, and anonymized app usage statistics to help us understand how our service is used and to improve it.
*   **Cookies & Tracking Technologies:** We may use cookies or similar technologies to enhance user experience, remember preferences, and track basic usage analytics.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

*   **To provide personalized outfit and color recommendations:** The **extracted skin, hair, and eye color data** are used solely for providing you with a personalized analysis of your appearance. This helps you understand your color tones and make informed style choices. You also have the option to modify the extracted tones manually within the app.
*   **To display your image for reference:** The original image you uploaded is displayed on the analysis screen solely for your reference during the analysis process and is not used for any other purpose.
*   To operate and maintain the service, including account management.
*   To improve app functionality, user experience, and analyze trends to enhance our AI performance based on aggregated, anonymized data.
*   To ensure the security of our app and prevent fraudulent activity.
*   To communicate with you regarding your account or service updates.

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We value your privacy and do not sell or rent your personal data.

*   **Face Data Sharing:** We **do not share your uploaded photos or the extracted skin, hair, and eye color data with any third parties.**
*   **Service Providers:** We may use third-party service providers for essential functions, such as:
    *   Cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for **temporarily storing your uploaded images.**
    *   Database hosting for storing your account information and **extracted color attributes.**
    *   Analytics services to help us understand app usage (using aggregated/anonymized data where possible).
    These providers are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and are only permitted to process your data based on our instructions and for the purposes outlined in this policy. They do not have the right to use your data for their own purposes.
*   **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, regulation, or in response to a valid legal request from law enforcement or regulatory authorities.
*   **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or other business transfer, your information may be transferred as part of the transaction. We will notify users before personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## 5. Data Security & Retention

*   **Security:** We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures, such as encryption and secure servers, to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Your uploaded images are stored on AWS S3, and extracted color attributes are saved in our secure database.
*   **Retention of Face-Related Data:**
    *   Your uploaded **image** is stored temporarily on AWS S3 only until you choose to retake your photo (at which point the previously uploaded image is deleted) or until you delete your account.
    *   The extracted **skin, hair, and eye color data** remains stored in our database as long as your user account is active, to provide you with continuous service.
*   **General Data Retention:** We retain other personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, provide the service, or comply with legal obligations.
*   **Account Deletion:** If you choose to **delete your account, all related data, including any stored images and extracted color data, will be permanently removed** from our servers in accordance with our standard deletion cycles. Users can request data deletion at any time through app settings or by contacting support (see Section 6).

## 6. Your Rights

You have rights regarding your personal information:

*   **Access & Correction:** You can review and update your account information directly within the app settings.
*   **Opt-Out of Gallery Access:** You can disable photo/gallery access permissions for the app at any time through your device's settings, although this will prevent the use of the core analysis feature.
*   **Data Deletion:** You have the right to request the deletion of your account and all associated personal data. You can do this through the app settings (if available) or by contacting us directly at [symmatricdev311@gmail.com](mailto:symmatricdev311@gmail.com). We will process your request in accordance with applicable laws.

## 7. Children's Privacy

SAI is designed for all ages. However, we strongly recommend that children under the age of 13 use the app only with the involvement and supervision of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal data directly from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without such consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.

## 8. Cancellations and Refunds

Users can modify or cancel their subscription plans at any time through their account settings or the relevant app store platform. However, please note that all payments made are final. No refunds will be issued for any reason, including for partial usage of a subscription period or dissatisfaction with the service. Any changes made to your subscription plan (like cancellation or downgrade) will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.
